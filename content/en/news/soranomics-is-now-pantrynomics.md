This is in line with our mega-overhaul that began in April. The main catalyst was finding out [Einstein's error in his Theory of General Relativity](https://superphysics.one/solutions/material/how-to-fix-general-relativity/). This then made it easy to match the laws of thermodynamics to our [laws of value](https://superphysics.one/pantrynomics/four-laws-of-value/) which then became the solid foundation of Pantrynomics as implemented through community pantries during the pandemic.

In a nutshell, the focus of SORA was the social network aspect of the economy -- the "Social" in "Social Resource Allocation."

The focus of Pantry, on the other hand, is the resource allocation and points-banking part. We realized that the latter is more critical. Moreover, the pantry-points system resembles the Inca moneyless system of qullqa-quipu where the qullqa are granaries and quipu are transaction records.
