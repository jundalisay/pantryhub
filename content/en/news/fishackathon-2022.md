We submitted our entry to the Fishackathon 2022 as Pantry Points. 

The system is inspired by the Inca empire which used granaries as qullqa and non-monetary valuation as quipu to circulate resources. Such a system was praised by Adam Smith for being more sustainable than the precious-metals-based system of the Spanish.

The Fishackathon is organized by [Each Mile](https://eachmile.co/) and Padang & Co
