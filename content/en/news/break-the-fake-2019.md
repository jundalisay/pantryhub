We're at Break the Fake to pitch SORA Beacon but didn't make any place.

[Break the Fake](http://breakthefakemovement.com) is a movement that holds hackathons sponsored by Facebook and the US State Department to solve fake news in democratic countries. It is organized by YSEALI alumni. 

In the Philippines, it was held in De La Salle University in Manila. 

> Update December 12, 2021: SORA Beacon is now Pantry Beacon
