Our entry is NARA or Non-Arbitrary Resource Allocation:

https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/emobile-pastoralism/projects/social-resource-allocation-sora

It focuses on pastoralism for African countries like Malawi. We deployed it on Heroku.

- Update December 12, 2021: NARA evolved to become SORA to focus on the social network feature, which then evolved into Pantry to focus on the Points feature
