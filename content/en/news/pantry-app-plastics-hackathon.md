We've decided to split SORA City into 'One' and 'Pantry' as part of the overhaul. The system now has four parts: Pantry, Hub, World and ISAIAH. SORA Health, Agreeculture, and Apprentice will be moved into Pantry.

We entered Pantry in the 3R Plastics Hackathon of the [UN-Habitat in the Philippines](http://unhabitat.org.ph) and made it to the preliminary round, but didn't make it to the Top 10. This is similar to us not making it to the Top 10 of the Pasig Climathon in 2019.
